This is an implementation of PGP as a Privly application. For more information on what Privly is, see [Priv.ly](https://priv.ly). For information on how we are using PGP, read about [injectable applications](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Injectable-Applications).

=== THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE - USE AT YOUR OWN RISKS ====

Currently the app supports basic encryption/decryption of content posted and retrieved from a content server. This is currently done with hard coded keys. Key management will be handled with an app that is still being developed.  

Tests are written to confirm correctness of the encryption, key generation, and signing and verification of encrypted messages. More to come soon.

## About ##

Privly is a developing set of Javascript applications for usable 
internet **content privacy.** It allows users to **view content on any website,** without 
the host site being able to read the content. The Privly extensions support 
"Privly Applications" (also known as Injectable Applications), which are web 
applications viewed within the context of other web applications. These 
applications can be any web application, but they are generally oriented to 
supporting a privacy use case.

For more information on what Privly is,

This repository is oriented to cross-platform development of Privly 
Applications, which are web applications viewed within the context of other web 
applications. Since Privly applications are not necessarily viewed inside an 
iframe, they also support layout as the top document in the browser.

The two current Privly applications are found in the PlainPost and Message
folders. They are currently bundled into the 
[Google Chrome Extension](https://github.com/privly/privly-chrome),
[Firefox Extension](https://github.com/privly/privly-firefox) and the hosted
[content server](https://github.com/privly/privly-web) as 
[Git Submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).

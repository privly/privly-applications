# Integration Testing

Note! You should already be aware of and knowledgeable in the
[testing guide](https://priv.ly/pages/develop#Testing101)
found on priv.ly.

## Why

Privly runs on many operating systems, browsers, and scripting contexts. Such
complexity requires a testing framework that can perform "user activities"
like logging in, creating content, viewing injected content, etc, across
many different integrated systems. Selenium is that testing framework.

## Integration Testing Versus Unit Testing

This testing framework tests the applications at the coarsest scale: where the
user interacts by clicking and typing into the browser. Another
type of testing, unit testing, breaks up the applications into isolated components.
Applications require both types of testing for them to reach production.

For more information on unit tests, read about Karma in the testing directory.

## How are Privly's integration tests architected?

Privly uses several technologies in concert for integration tests.
Since these technologies are best supported in the Ruby programming language,
several Ruby libraries are used. Selenium Webdriver is a combination of
a connection library and scripting language for operating a web browser
programmatically. Since dealing with asynchronous actions and other
issues can be painful in plain Selenium Webdriver, we use
[Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) as a scripting language
on top of Webdriver. Capybara's interactions with the web browser have expected
results that should be the basis of tests. These tests are written with
Ruby's unit testing library. Each unit test case is in the "specs" folder.
Tests are each in their own file with "tc_" (test case) prepended and groups of
tests are collected into files with "ts_" (test suite) prepended.

To run your tests you can: (a) include them in an existing test case,
(b) copy an existing test case, modify it, and "require_relative"
it from an existing test suite, or (c) "require_relative" the file at the bottom
of the run_all.rb file.

## Prerequisites

To run these tests you need to download several software packages.

* Ruby 1.9.3 or higher. This has been tested on 1.9.3.
* The browser you are testing against (Chrome and Firefox are currently available).
* A running [content server](https://github.com/privly/privly-web). This is necessary
even if you are not testing the content server because the extension tests will
expect to have a place it can store content.
* Several gems are required and can be installed with bundler, which is installed
with `gem install bundler`.
* Once you have bundler, you can install all the remaining prerequisites by changing
into the directory about this one and running: `bundle install`. In the future you may
need to re-run bundler to install updates with `bundle update` and `bundle install`.

## Running Integration Tests Locally

If you want to run the tests on SauceLabs, then we recommend you setup the tests locally
first so you know what to expect. Running on a set of virtualized browsers is not
complicated but it is easy to get wrong.

Assuming you have setup the proper systems as above, you can run several different
browsers and scripting contexts. First **ensure you are testing the applications
from a context that can be tested...**

Again, !ensure you are testing the applications from a context that can be tested!.
This means that if you are going to test the applications in the Firefox Extension
context, that you are running the tests from the privly-applications folder of the
Firefox extension. If this is not the case, then the applications will not be built
properly.

Valid testing contexts include:

**firefox_web:** run Firefox locally without an extension. So long as you have
a webserver running locally, this should succeed.

**chrome_web:** run Chrome locally without an extension. So long as you have
a webserver running locally, this should succeed.

**firefox_extension:** run Firefox locally with an extension. You should only run
this from the privly-applications directory of the privly-firefox extension.

**chrome_extension:** run Chrome locally with an extension. You should only run
this from the privly-applications directory of the privly-chrome extension.

You can run each of these from the `privly-applications/test/selenium` directory with
`ruby run_all.rb -p INSERT_PLATFORM_HERE -r experimental -c http://localhost:3000`.
The corresponding browser will be opened and the specs included by `run_all.rb` will be run.

## Running Integration Tests on Sauce Labs

Since no individual dev has all 100+ supported scripting contexts, it is often
necessary to test against the hundreds of virtualized browsers found on SauceLabs.

Each test requires **SauceConnect to be running**, as well as **a local webserver.**

To run SauceConnect, follow [this web page](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/).

To launch on Sauce, you need to replace the `@sauce_url` variable in configurations.rb
with the URL for your SauceLabs account. You can find that URL if you are logged
in to SauceLab's website by visiting [this web page](https://saucelabs.com/docs/ondemand/getting-started/env/ruby/se2/mac)
when you are logged in and viewing the specially formatted URL that SauceLabs
displays for you.

### sauce_firefox_web

This will launch the current Beta version of Firefox on Windows. It will navigate the
webserver you have running on localhost so make sure that is where the application files are that you want to test.

From the privly-applications directory, run: `ruby run_all.rb -p sauce_firefox_web -c http://localhost:3000 -r experimental`

### sauce_firefox_extension

This will launch the current Beta version of Firefox on Windows. It will navigate the
extension from which you launched the tests, but the applications expect localhost:3000 to present a content server for storage.

From the privly-applications directory, run: `ruby run_all.rb -p sauce_firefox_extension -c http://localhost:3000 -r experimental`

### sauce_chrome_web

This will launch the current Beta version of Chrome on Windows. It will navigate the
webserver you have running on localhost so make sure that is where the application files are that you want to test.

From the privly-applications directory, run: `ruby run_all.rb -p sauce_chrome_web -c http://localhost:3000 -r experimental`

### sauce_chrome_extension

This will launch the current Beta version of Chrome on Windows. It will navigate the
extension from which you launched the tests, but the applications expect localhost:3000 to present a content server for storage.

From the privly-applications directory, run: `ruby run_all.rb -p sauce_chrome_extension -c http://localhost:3000 -r experimental`

### sauce_safari_web

This will launch Safari on Windows. It will navigate the
webserver you have running on localhost so make sure that is where the applicaion files are that you want to test.

From the privly-applications directory, run: `ruby run_all.rb -p sauce_chrome_web -c http://localhost:3000 -r experimental`

## TravisCI

The best part of SauceLabs is that the tests can run on every commit you push
to GitHub without you needing to run them locally. To configure this you will need
to use TravisCI's secure environment variable to assign the environment variable
`SAUCE_URL` to the URL. For example:

    export SAUCE_URL=http://privly:afafafaf-afaf-afaf-afaf-afafafafafa0@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub
